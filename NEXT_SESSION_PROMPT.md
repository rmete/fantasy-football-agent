We're continuing the GPT Agent Browser Automation implementation.

Please read /Users/rileymete/Desktop/Projects/fantasy-football-agent/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md to understand what's been completed.

Summary:
- Backend is 100% complete (browser automation, credentials, screenshots, API)
- Frontend is 30% complete (types, Redux slice done)
- Need to build 6 UI components + 1 page + settings update

Next steps in order:
1. Create tool-call-card.tsx component
2. Create step-timeline.tsx component
3. Create screenshot-strip.tsx component
4. Create control-panel.tsx component
5. Create agent-status-badge.tsx component
6. Create agent-window/index.tsx (main component)
7. Create app/agent/page.tsx route
8. Update app/settings/page.tsx with credentials section
9. Test end-to-end
10. Polish UI

All components go in: frontend/components/agent-window/

Reference the detailed specs in IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md for each component.

Let's start with tool-call-card.tsx - build it according to the specs.
